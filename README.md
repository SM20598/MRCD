# [MRCD: Multi Robot Campus Dataset](https://sm20598.github.io)

Welcome to the MRCD dataset for outdoor mobile wheeled robotics! This ROS2 Humble dataset is designed to support algorithm development and benchmarking for perception, localization, and navigation in real-world outdoor environments. The dataset features a variety of challenging outdoor sequence for outdoor mobile robots.

* Our dataset features high-quality sensor dataâ€”including:
  + HD720 30 FPS stereo frontal camera streams
  + High resolution visual pointcloud
  + HD720 30 FPS mono depth + colored ground-facing camera streams 
  + 3D spinning LiDAR
  + High quality IMUs (raw accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer data) 
  + Odometry of our wheeled robot
  + Highly accurate GPS-measurements
  + Continuous ground truth
* High resolution large scale survey grade prior map of our campus
* A handful of ROS2 Humble SOTA SLAM algorithms.
