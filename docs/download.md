# Download MRCD
Below you find the download links for the MRCD dataset. We provide different versions of MRCD, including comprehensive bags and additional lightweight bags. For non-visual algorithm development, we recommend the *Lightweight bags. For comprehensive algorithm development, which requires visual data, we recommend the comprehensive bags.

## Complete Versions

Below you find links to download all 8 sequences as complete versions of MRCD, including *Lightweight*, *Comprehensive*, *Survey-Grad Prior Map*, and *Continous Ground Truth*. Note that the dataset is large and may take a while to download. Make sure to have enough space on you local disc.
