# [MRCD: Mobile Robot Campus Dataset](https://sm20598.github.io)

Welcome to the MRCD dataset for outdoor mobile wheeled robotics! This ROS2 Humble dataset is designed to support algorithm development and benchmarking for perception, localization, and navigation in real-world outdoor environments. The dataset features a variety of challenging outdoor sequence for outdoor mobile robots.

## Highlights
* Our dataset features high-quality sensor data—including:
  + 📷 HD720 30 FPS stereo frontal camera streams
  + ☁️ High resolution visual frontal pointcloud
  + 📷 HD720 30 FPS mono depth + colored ground-facing camera streams 
  + 📏 3D spinning LiDAR
  + ⬆️ High quality IMUs (raw accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer data) 
  + 🛞 Odometry of our wheeled robot
  + 📍 Highly accurate GPS-measurements
  + 👣 Embedded discrete and continuous external ground truth
* Comprehensive bags, including all sensor modalities and recordings
* Additional lightweight bags, excluding visual data
* High resolution large scale survey grade prior map of the campus environment
* A handful of ROS2 Humble SOTA SLAM algorithms.
